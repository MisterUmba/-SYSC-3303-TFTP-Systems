# SYSC3303-TFTP
Project for comp 3303 at Carleton University

The project consists of 3 programs, a TFTPCLient, a TFTPServer, and a TFTP Error Simulator. 
The client writes files to the server and can read files from the server
The server receives requests from the client and responds appropriately
The error simulator will manufacture errors into the file transfer to test the server and client program's error detection capability.
